## JMPlib

Dynamic languages are widely used due to the flexibility needed in some applications or systems. Therefore, dynamic language metaprogramming features have been incorporated gradually to statically-typed languages. Our work is aimed to improve the flexibility of Java language without modifying the Java Virtual Machine. We developed a library that allows Java language to support two types of metaprogramming features: 1) structural intercession y 2) dynamic code evaluation. This was achieved using class versioning, code instrumentation and Hot-Swapping. In conclusion, the library allows programmers to use these two functionalities in new or legacy code to improve its runtime flexibility.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ilagartos/jmplib/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
